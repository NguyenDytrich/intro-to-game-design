# Introduction to Video Game Design (with Unity)

### About
This repository contains all code and PR requests for my 20-hour *Introduction to Video Game Design* course. The course focuses on building out simple arcade games each module. In the `/Modules` folder, you will find each module and its relevant Unity project. Each folder is its own project, so you can add the module's folder to Unity.

### Modules
1. SnakeGame
2. Tower Defense
3. Asteroids
